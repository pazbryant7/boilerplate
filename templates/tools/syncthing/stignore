# Syncthing ignore patterns for Obsidian Vault
# Ignore the .git directory
.git/

# Obsidian-specific ignores (optional, but recommended for cross-device consistency)
# The .obsidian folder contains settings, plugins, workspaces.
# Often, you want different settings/plugin states on different devices (PC vs. Phone).
# If you want separate settings for PC and mobile:
.obsidian/

# Common temporary/system files to ignore (good practice)
~*.md # Temporary Obsidian lock files (tilde prefix)
.DS_Store # macOS specific
Thumbs.db # Windows specific
ehthumbs.db # Windows specific
desktop.ini # Windows specific
.fuse_hidden* # Linux specific
.*.swp # Vim/Neovim swap files
*.bak # Generic backup files
*~ # Emacs/various editor backup files
# etc.

# Example: If you have a folder for attachments that you DON'T want to sync to mobile due to size:
# attachments/
# my_huge_images/
